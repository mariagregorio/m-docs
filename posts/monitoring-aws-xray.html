            <h1>Monitoring: Traces with AWS X-Ray</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Let's start by noticing the importance of the concept of <b>Monitoring</b>.</p>
                <p>Monitoring can make our life a lot easier, it can help us:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent issues or be able to find issues before the client does.</li>
                    <li>If a bug was already found, we can track it's root cause faster</li>
                    <li>Find where performance can be optimized</li>
                    <li>Plan scalling by analyzing current trends</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    AWS provides a variety of tools for monitoring, but today i want to focus on
                    X-Ray, a tool for adding <b>traces</b> to our app, and also create some cool
                    <b>Service maps</b> of the components of our apps to help us visualize the big
                    picture and see how components interact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a microservices architechture, it becomes a tedious task to debug errors,
                    tracking them or analyze how the app is performing using the regular tools like
                    checking the production logs or attempting to reproduce the bug locally and
                    adding a bunch of logs along the way to track the request to the point it fails.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is when traces become handy, and there are a bunch of tools out there that
                    can can do this for us (Sentry, Datadog, etc). AWS X-Ray is the tracing service
                    that AWS offers, and because we are already using AWS for our infrastructure,
                    it's a natural choice to start exploring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tracing allows you to track a particular request in your app, end to end, and
                    get useful information about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A trace is basically all the data collected from a request end to end. These
                    traces are made of <b>segments</b>, which represent components that deal with
                    the request, and <b>sub segments</b> which we can manually add in our code to
                    provide more specific data (for example, collect data from a call to a third
                    party API and put it in a sub segment to later analyze the latency of that API
                    call).
                </p>

                <p>
                    By default, only a certain percent of requests are traced, this is called
                    <b>sampling</b>. By default, the first request each second, and five percent of
                    any additional requests are recorded, but we can configure this and change it to
                    our needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To enable Xray, some services like Lambda only require a configuration change,
                    and for some other services we need to add some minor code changes using the
                    X-Ray SDK. This is known as <b>instrumenting</b> the app.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Demo</h2>
                <p>
                    We will be using a small demo project to get started with Xray. The project uses
                    Node.js with Typescript and Serverless Framework.
                </p>

                    to follow along
                </div>
                <p>
                    We have a lambda function that is triggered by a POST request to an API Gateway
                    resource. The lambda has some logic that calls a thrid party API and saves data
                    to a DynamoDB table. It's a very simple example just to illustrate how tracing
                    works, which are the steps needed to get started, picture how it would look in a
                    more complex project, and how we could benefit from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some services can provide traces by just setting a configuration, that would be
                    the case of Lambda and API Gateway in our example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first step is to enable Xray tracing by adding the tracing attribute under
                    provider to our Serverless configuration yml.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can also be done by activating tracing in the configuration in the Lambda
                    and API Gateway stage, using the AWS console. We also need to add the
                    permissions required to create traces under iamRoleStatements.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    provider:<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;name: aws<br />

                </div>
                <p>
                    To provide traces for other services used in our Lambda like Dynamo, it is
                    necessary to use the SDK for X-Ray, and capture the Dynamo client by wrapping it
                    with the <span class="code">captureAWSv3Client</span> function provided by the
                    SDK. This way, all calls to Dynamo client will be intercepted by Xray to get
                    tracing data.
                </p>

                <p>1) Install the package</p>
                <div class="code-block">$ npm install aws-xray-sdk-core</div>

                <p>2) Import default from <span class="code">aws-xray-sdk-core</span></p>

                <div class="code-block">import AWSXRay from 'aws-xray-sdk-core';</div>

                <p>
                    3) "Wrap" the Dynamo client instance with
                    <span class="code">AWSXRay.captureAWSv3Client</span>
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    export const client = AWSXRay.captureAWSv3Client(new DynamoDBClient({ region:
                    'us-east-1' }));
                </div>

                <p>And now we can get traces from the Put command used in our code.</p>

                <p>
                    The next thing that I want to cover, is the external API call we have in our
                    code. This can be userful to later measure the latency of the call, for example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this we can create a subsegment inside our lambda segment to provide this
                    information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To create the subsegment, first we need to get the current segment we are
                    working on, which in our case is the lambda function.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    const segment = AWSXRay.getSegment(); //returns the facade segment
                </div>

                <p>Then create the subsegment using addNewSubsegment, and give it a name.</p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    const subsegment = segment.addNewSubsegment('CurrencyAPIcall');
                </div>

                <p>
                    As part of the instrumentation, we can add annotations and metadata to segments
                    or subsegments. Annotations are meant to be short pieces of information that we
                    can later use for filtering and grouping traces according to our needs, and
                    metadata is useful to record data of any type that we want to keep in our traces
                    but don't need to be used for filtering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To illustrate it, we can add an annotation to our sub segment, providing the
                    currency information received from the body of the request, and maybe later use
                    it to filter traces with a particular value for currency.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    subsegment.addAnnotation('currency', parsedBody.price.currency);
                </div>

                <p>
                    Now we also want to be able to tell when there is an error calling this API, and
                    for that we need to call addError on the sub segment on the catch block.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">
                    subsegment.addError(`Error on currency convertion API call
                    ${JSON.stringify(e)}`);
                </div>

                <p>
                    also remember to close the subsegment when the operation we are tracing is
                    completed.
                </p>

                <div class="code-block">subsegment.close();</div>

                <p>
                    We are ready to deploy and try sending a request to see how this looks. To check
                    the traces, look for the Cloudwatch service, and on the left panel, find X-Ray
                    traces.
                </p>

                <div class="image-block">
                    <img src="monitoring-aws-xray/Screenshot1.png" alt="AWS X-Ray" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    After making a request to the API endpoint, we can go to Traces and find a brand
                    new trace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scroll down to see a list of the latest traces, and click on the ID of the
                    latest trace to see the details.
                </p>

                <div class="image-block">
                    <img src="monitoring-aws-xray/Screenshot2.png" alt="AWS X-Ray" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    Here we can see the <b>Service map</b>, which may look simple, but you can
                    visualize how in a bigger service with more components, this can act like an
                    architecture diagram that helps you understand th interaction between components
                    and the flow of the request.
                </p>

                <div class="image-block">
                    <img src="monitoring-aws-xray/Screenshot3.png" alt="AWS X-Ray" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    Scroll down to see a detail of what happens inside each of the segments and
                    subsegments. Here we can see the subsegment we created, the duration of the API
                    call and all the other executions. And by clicking on one of them, you can see a
                    right panel show the information for annotations, metadata, exceptions and more.
                </p>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <img src="monitoring-aws-xray/Screenshot4.png" alt="AWS X-Ray" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    Now let's simulate an error in the currency API call to see how this will look
                    on the trace.
                </p>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <img src="monitoring-aws-xray/Screenshot5.png" alt="AWS X-Ray" />
                </div>

                <div class="image-block">
                    <img src="monitoring-aws-xray/Screenshot6.png" alt="AWS X-Ray" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    We can see the details in the error we added to our subsegment, and we can
                    visualize exactly what happened, and the point the request could reach until it
                    failed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, with the annotation we created for currency, we can make queries to
                    filter traces, and find the exact cases we want to analyze. For example, let's
                    add <span class="code">annotation.currency = "MXN"</span> to filter traces with
                    value "MXN" in the annotation key currency
                </p>
                <div class="image-block">
                    <img src="monitoring-aws-xray/Screenshot7.png" alt="AWS X-Ray" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    There is a lot more to explore here, but I hope that this serves as a starting
                    point and that you can see the potential of this tool and how useful it can be
                    for your project.
